Ed-Fi Data Checker Level 2 Validations github repository

This is a repository of JSON files that contain Level2 data validations for EdFi implementations. These files are exported and imported from the Data Checker application or potentially other data validation engines.

The repository is organized into a folder for each 'suite' release of EdFi, currency 2x and 3x.

File names should match the name of the collection that the file contains.

The Master branch should contain the most current version of each file. As validation rules change from year to year, the last file for the previous school year should be associated with a tag for that school year.
